    question: "What is the difference between psychiatry and therapy?",
    answer: "Therapy is a safe space for you to talk about what's on your mind. A therapist is a qualified mental health professional who offers support and helps you find the strength to cope with difficult emotions and experiences. Therapists, however, are not equipped to provide you with medication for your concerns. Psychiatry is a sector of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of mental, emotional and behavioural difficulties. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who is equipped to provide you with medication for your mental health concerns. For more support, your psychiatrist may suggest that you seek therapy.",
